# Group 43 Project SYT

Welcome to Share Your Thoughts, a online voting system software build by Group 43!
Here is the instruction for installation:

## Install and Run

- open terminal
- use cd to access the software files "~/directory/syt"

## Important notes

Since this software uses Node.js, it is recommended to install Node.js for windows first, if not, use a linux based operating system. Biggest recommendation is running ubuntu in a virtual machine.
